# Minecraft-MOTD-Maker
An open-source code which will produce code for the Minecraft Server's MOTD, including options for coloured text and more.
Allows for the creation of custom MOTD's (the words under Minecraft servers' title) allowing 16 different colours. This was created due to the difficulty of putting one together
